**Lipid signatures for determining the outcome of embryo implantation during in vitro fertilization**, The present invention relates to new methods for predicting the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures, as well as selecting the subjects to undergo IVF treatments. It also relates to methods for selecting IVF treatments and decision-making in said treatments as well as wash solutions for use in the treatment of infertility.  
ID Patent: PCT/EP2020/072846 

### [WO2018007511](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2018007511&_cid=P20-KV80E2-10993-1) 
**Diagnostic methods based on lipid profiles**, The present invention relates to methods for the diagnosis of NAFLD in a subject, and for the differential diagnosis of NASH or steatosis in a subject suffering from NAFLD, based on the determination in a sample of metabolic markers, particularly lipid metabolic markers.  
ID Patent: EP16382320.6 
  
### [WO2018007422](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2018007422&_cid=P20-KV80GF-12038-1) 
**Identification of human Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subtypes**, The present invention is directed to a profiling method for subtypes in non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients and to diagnostic methods within those subtypes to discriminate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) versus steatosis patients.  
ID Patent: EP16382319.8 |
  
### [WO2017055397](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2017055397&_cid=P20-KV80HV-12559-1) 
**Metabolomic signature of diagnosis and disease progression in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**, The present invention is directed to a diagnostic method for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to a method for monitoring the progression of the disease based on the determination of the levels of different metabolites. The invention also provides a method for determining the efficacy of an NAFLD therapy and a method for identification of compounds suitable for the treatment of NAFLD.  
ID Patent: EP15382477.6

EXAMPLES
How should you List Pending Patents on your Resume?

Even for this category, again, there is no standard format. A style, modeled on the above CMOS, can be used to list pending patents:

[Last name, first name of the inventor.] [The year the patent was filed.] [The title of the invention.] [Country Patent Application number,] filed [Month Date, Year.] Patent Pending.

Example:

Doe, J. 2009. Method to enhance the performance of multimedia-rich applications on computer systems with single-core CPUs. U.S. Patent Application 20000000000, filed January 2009. Patent Pending.

NOTE: The above example is used for illustrative purpose only.

Conclusion: Whether youâ€™ve granted or pending patents, list them on your resume, with a format like the Chicago Manual of Style, to bring your talent to the fore.
