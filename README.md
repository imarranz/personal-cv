I have completed a doctoral thesis entitled “Genetic Algorithms Applied to Translational Strategy in MASH. Learning from Mouse Models”, carried out under the supervision of José María Mato (General Director of CIC bioGUNE) and Dae-Jin Lee (Data Science line leader at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, BCAM). In this work, I applied genetic algorithms to identify subtypes of NAFLD based on metabolic features. The methodology developed can be extended to other diseases characterized by metabolic alterations, offering promising applications in the field of precision medicine.

## A. Personal Statement

Dr. Ibon Martínez-Arranz, PhD, got his BSc. in Mathematics from the University of the Basque Country (EHU/UPV) and completed an MSc. in Current Applied Statistics Techniques and an MSc. in Mathematical Modeling Research, Statistical Analysis and Computing Sciences. In 2004, he joined the Basque Country Health Service (The Department of Health of the Basque Country Government and Osakidetza) as a data analyst, focusing primarily on epidemiological reporting for renal patients. When he joined OWL Metabolomics in 2010, Ibon first worked as a researcher in the Metabolomics Department, and in 2017, he became the Head of the Data Science Department, being responsible for predictive modeling and statistical computing. His highly experienced team supports metabolomics services, laboratory processes, data handling, R&D projects, and technology transfer processes.

### Data mining of 'omics' data

'Omics' research generates a large amount of data for every sample. OWL has established a well-defined workflow and a set of guidelines for analyzing omics data. It includes statistical design of experiments, data structuration and predictive modelling.

### Predictive algorithms for disease diagnosis

We have developed predictive algorithms for several diseases. We have been really involved in the development and validation of the OWLiver, OWLiver F2+ and OWLiver DM2 tests.
